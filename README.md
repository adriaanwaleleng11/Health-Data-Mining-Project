# Health-Data-Mining-Project
Participated in a class group project with 4 other friends to do data mining on a survey that collects health data from unclassified workers in Indonesia. Attempted to do classifications of a few diseases using personal health indicators and sociodemographic factors using logistic regression and CatBoost. Also did multiple visualizations of data to find possibly existing patterns related to diseases based on sociodemographic factors.
